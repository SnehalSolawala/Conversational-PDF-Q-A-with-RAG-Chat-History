# Conversational-PDF-Q-A-with-RAG-Chat-History
This project is a Streamlit-based conversational chatbot that allows users to upload multiple PDFs and interact with their content. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve relevant information from the uploaded documents and provide precise answers. The chatbot also maintains chat history of previous conversation.
